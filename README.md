🏡 Real Estate Price Prediction — Machine Learning Project
- A machine learning project that predicts house prices based on key property features such as location, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage.
- This project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, model evaluation, and a Flask API for real-time prediction.

📌 Project Description
- The goal of this project is to develop an end-to-end machine learning system that predicts real estate prices.
  It covers:
- Data exploration & cleaning
- Feature selection & engineering
- Building multiple ML models
- Selecting the best performing model
- Exporting the model using pickle
- Flask API for deployment
- Frontend integration for live predictions
- This solution can help users, developers, and businesses estimate home prices based on historical market data and key housing features.

🔍 Key Features
